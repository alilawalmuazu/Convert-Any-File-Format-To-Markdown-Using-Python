To convert various file formats (CSV, PDF, Word, Excel, TXT, etc.) to Markdown using Python, you can use different libraries for each file format. Below is an example of how you can achieve this using various libraries:
Make sure to install the necessary libraries using pip if you haven't already:
pip install PyPDF2 python-docx pandas nbformat
OR
!pip install PyPDF2 python-docx pandas nbformat
This code demonstrates how to convert each file format to Markdown individually. If you need to combine multiple formats into a single Markdown document, you'll need to handle the merging of Markdown strings accordingly.
